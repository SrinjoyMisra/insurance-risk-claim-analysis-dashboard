# ðŸ“Š Insurance Risk & Claim Analysis

Insurance companies deal with vast amounts of policyholder and claims data, often scattered across multiple sources. This makes it challenging to track performance, assess risks, and identify business opportunities. This project provides a centralized interactive Power BI dashboard that brings all key metrics together in one place. It enables stakeholders to:

#âšª Monitor policies, claims, and risk distribution in real-time.

#âšª Identify customer segments and high-risk categories.

#âšª Support data-driven decision making for pricing, underwriting, and fraud detection.


# ðŸ“Œ KPI Requirements

The following KPIs were identified as essential:

1. Total Policies â€“ Measure the size of the active customer base.

2. Total Claim Amount â€“ Track the overall financial impact of claims.

3. Claim Frequency â€“ Monitor how often claims occur.

4. Average Claim Amount â€“ Assess claim severity and potential risk exposure.

5. Gender-wise Total Policies â€“ Understand customer distribution for segmentation and targeting.



# ðŸ“Š Chart / Visualization Requirements

To go beyond KPIs and uncover deeper insights, multiple visualizations were created:

1. By Car Use (Donut Chart) â€“ Analyze distribution of claims by usage type (private, commercial).

2. By Car Maker (Bar Chart) â€“ Identify brands with higher claims and policies.

3. By Coverage Zone (Donut Chart) â€“ Evaluate claims geographically (urban, rural, etc.).

4. By Age Group (Histogram) â€“ Assess policyholder demographics and age-related risks.

5. By Car Year (Area Chart) â€“ Show how car age impacts claims.

6. By Kids Driving (Ribbon Chart) â€“ Compare impact of young drivers in households.

7. By Education (Pie Chart) â€“ Study correlation of education with claims.

8. By Education & Marital Status (Matrix Heat Grid) â€“ Highlight combined effect of socio-demographics on claims.
